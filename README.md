# CITEseq_Screening_CARs
code for paper "A Multimodal multimodal single cell assay identifies optimized binders for a bicistronic CAR against GPC2 OR CD276 to overcome heterogeneity in treating Neuroblastoma"
1) CARpipeline is used to detect CAR identity per cell.
2) CITEseq_Rscript is used to process CITE-seq data before and after addding CAR identities data
